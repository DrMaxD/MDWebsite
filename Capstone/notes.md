# 9. HOW A COMPANY LIKE STEVE MADDEN COULD ACQUIRE K-SWISS

## Acquisition Path:
1. **Direct Purchase from KP Global**:
   - Engage Ding Shun Investment (owner of KP Global) directly.
   - Due diligence would involve KP Global’s convertible bonds, inventory, and licensing agreements.

2. **Negotiated Private Sale**:
   - Deal would be a **private equity-style acquisition**, requiring negotiation with the Ding family.
   - Asset-only deal (excluding Palladium) could simplify the transaction.

3. **Structure Options**:
   - Outright purchase of K-Swiss subsidiary (K-Swiss Holdings, Inc.)
   - Stock/share acquisition of KP Global or carve-out deal from KP Global

4. **Regulatory and Brand Considerations**:
   - No anti-trust concerns expected
   - U.S. brand HQ means favorable transition for Steve Madden’s U.S.-centric infrastructure

## Recommended Price Range:
- Estimated purchase price: **$130M–$160M**
- Premium pricing (~$180M) only justifiable with a clear turnaround roadmap
- Lower-end ($120M) viable if Steve Madden assumes some operational debt or restructuring risk

## Strategic Fit:
- Steve Madden’s design and marketing capabilities can rejuvenate K-Swiss
- Strong retail presence, DTC operations, and licensing management align well with K-Swiss needs
- K-Swiss could be repositioned under Steve Madden as an athletic-lifestyle crossover brand (similar to how Adidas manages sub-brands)
