## Summary

MDWebsite is a website designed to advertise myself (Max Debin) and demonstrate by web development abilities. This project was inspired by multiple friends who have all created and recomended creating a personal website. This project was created with HTML, CSS, and Python to run a website using FLASK. The website is connected to a postgres database which will allow a user to enter their contact information as well as a message within a contact me page. The information would be stored within a database where I would look at the information and respond as soon as possible. Additionally, users will be able to see my resume which has been created using TEX, other projects I have worked on, and an about me section where I will talk about myself more.
