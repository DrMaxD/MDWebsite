      <p>Hi, My name is Max Debin. I'm a student at Marist University studying cybersecurity. Whether it's within cybersecurity, music, or anything else, I always push myself to reach as high as possible, being motivated by the innovations of new technologies
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am the president of my schools cybersecurity club, where we host weekly meetings to discuss and teach topics relating to the field of cybersecurity through weekly meetings. 
        Additionally I am also a research intern on a project that focuses on the prioritzation of vulnrabilities using a version of GPT to map vulnrabilities to attack techniques from the MITRE ATT&K framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of cybersecurity, I am also a skilled musician, playing the saxophone for over 11 years. 
        I've always had a passion for music, being a part of multiple ensembles, being able to play multiple instruments, and dedicating many hours to become as skilled as I am today.
