      <p>During the summer of 2024, I spent my time as a part time employee at best buy working as a geek squad agent. 
        During this time, I assisted customers with their technology related issues such as software isntallation, device setup/data transfer, and general trouble shooting.
        Throughout my time as a geek squad agent, I thrived working in a fast paced enviroment, 
        improved communication skills with customers (clients) and gained a more general knowledge of a variety of daily software people may use

      <p>PROJECT CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT</p>
      <!--<p>MDServer is a minecraft server created to demonstrate my abilities in server hosting/ managment, java progragming capabilities. 
        The server itself is being hosted on a linux pc which will run whenever needed as to not use up to much electricity. 
        The server will run using a custom datapack that will modify the game a bit to make it more enjoyable, 
        such as increased minecarft speeds, new mob attributes, and modified textures. The world itself will be a personal survival world for me to play in.
         Other could join the world in spectator mode and visit a museum created to view all the changes made through the datapack.</p>-->
